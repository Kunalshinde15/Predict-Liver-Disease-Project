Objective: The objective of the project is to build a predictive model to diagnose liver disease in patients.

Data Collection: Data will be collected from various sources such as medical records, lab reports, and patient demographics.

Data Preparation: Data cleaning and pre-processing will be performed to ensure the quality of the data. Data normalization and standardization techniques will also be applied to prepare the data for analysis.

Feature Selection: Feature selection techniques will be used to identify the most important variables that affect the diagnosis of liver disease.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Exploratory data analysis will be performed to understand the patterns and relationships in the data, as well as to identify any outliers or anomalies.

Model Selection: Various statistical and machine learning algorithms will be evaluated to select the best model that can accurately diagnose liver disease.

Model Training: The selected model will be trained using the data to learn the patterns and relationships in the data.

Model Validation: The trained model will be validated using a hold-out dataset to ensure that it can generalize well to new data.

Model Evaluation: The performance of the model will be evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Deployment: The final model will be deployed in a production environment to diagnose liver disease in new patients.

Monitoring: The model's performance will be monitored regularly, and if necessary, the model will be retrained or updated to improve its accuracy.

Communication: The results of the project will be communicated to stakeholders, including medical professionals, patients, and other interested parties.
